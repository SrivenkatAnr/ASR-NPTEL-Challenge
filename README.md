# ASR-NPTEL-Challenge
## What is this about?
This challenge is held to help advance State-of-the-Art performance in Artificial Speech Recognition and spread the spirit 
of research for the same. Conducted by the Speech Processing Lab of IITM under Dr. Umesh S., this is a particularly 
difficult challenge of generating transcripts from audio files from actual [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/) lectures 
originally in Hindi. 
The text data has been manually constructed and cleaned by numerous transcriber by NPTEL. We are releasing about 40 
hours subset of hindi audio along with the corresponding transcripts and time-stamps. The challenge is open to all 
irrespective of being individuals, teams or organizations. 

A baseline of GMM-HMM and TDNN models are set up and the pre-trained model weights are available for download (discussed
below).


## Guidelines
- The data can be freely downloaded after filling up a google doc and agreeing to the *License of Fair Use*. The data 
will also be publicly available after the end of the challenge in the good spirit of research, development and 
advancement of the Speech Recognition domain of the Deep Learning community.
- Any additional data can be used for training (public and private) as long as the participant(s) have legal rights over 
it. The Lab and and Institute in no way will be held responsible in any way with respect to copyright claims of the 
participant's data.
- Submissions are to be made [here]. A leaderboard is be maintained regularly and can be checked [here].
